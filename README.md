# Instructions on how to join `The Attik`

## How to get started?

Currently, the project is in alpha version and is operating on the `Avalanche FUJI C-Chain (TestNet)`.

### 1. Set your Wallet's Network to `Avalanche FUJI C-Chain (TestNet)`

Most probably you will have to add it manually, so here is the required information:

* **Network Name:** Avalanche FUJI C-Chain
* **New RPC URL:** https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
* **Chain ID:** 43113
* **Symbol:** AVAX
* **Block Explorer URL:** https://cchain.explorer.avax-test.network

### 2. Go to `https://faucet.avax-test.network/` so you get 10 AVAX to start with.

You can copy your Wallet's address and request 10 AVAX at the foregoing link once per hour.

### 3. Next, we will wait for you in [The Attik](http://master.dpt78yh95ixsf.amplifyapp.com/) to authenticate via the Wallet that uses `Avalanche FUJI C-Chain (TestNet)` as network.

### 4. Create an Auction Room with one of your NFTs and share the URL to your friends! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ 

All of the NFTs should be and will be stored on the Avalanche's TestNet Chain throughout the Alpha phase.

### 5. Enjoy the lovely experience! At the end, the winner of the auction takes the NFT home - sweet victory with a very great prize! ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘

Once the Auction had come to an end, the winner receives the NFT into the wallet he authenticated with.

## And, of course, stay tuned for further exciting features!

Just a tiny part from what our team had planned for you is:

### Did you think that only Auctions bring friends together?

A whole lot of other events are coming to `The Attik`, such as **Giveaway Parties**, **Karaoke Nights**, **P2E minigames** and so much more!

### Also, why don't we leave the show to be stolen from us by other talanted developers/freelancers?

We are up for any collaborations on different types of events, so do not hesitate to contact us if you want to see your idea alive here, at `The Attik`!
